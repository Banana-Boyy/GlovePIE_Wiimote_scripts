# GlovePIE_Wiimote_scripts
Some Wiimote scripts i made for glovePIE while bored one day so I can play games using a wiimote and nunchuck. This includes a simple script for most 3D games, along with one for CS:S (originally for CS2 but that game doesnt like to work with the mouse controls for some reason) and one for The Binding of Isaac.
